IBM
Module 1:
In this module, you will get introduced to the problem that we will try to solve throughout the course. You will also learn how to load the image dataset, manipulate 
images, and visualize them.
Module 2:
In this Module, you will mainly learn how to process image data and prepare it to build a classifier using pre-trained models.
Module 3:
In this Module, in the PyTorch part, you will learn how to build a linear classifier. In the Keras part, you will learn how to build an image classifier using the ResNet50 pre-trained model.
